DAY 1: Create basic version of game


DOCS:

    CLASSES:

        GAME - 
            Initalization requires no inputs but does set the turn counter to 0 and the board to be blank
            
            description - This class creates the game board itself not including 
                          the AI but instead handling and delivering the game state
                          to the player and AI
    FUNCTIONS:
        shift_board(self,move=[0<=integer<=2, 0<=integer<=2]) -
            inputs are self and a list containing 2 values -
                both ints in second input are greater than / equal to 0 and are less than / equal to 2

            description - uses coordinates to set a square either to 1(X) or 0(O)

            return values - 1 if the square has not been changed or if the square does not exist
                            0 if a square on self.board has been successfully changed
                            -1 if the game is over
        check_wins(self) - 
            input value is self

            description - checks if their is a winning state on the board

            return values - 0 if a win exists
                            1 if now win exists
        get_board(self, write_board=False) -
            input value is self and write_board, a True/False value that decides whether the board should print or jsut return

            description - prints visually nice version of board

            return value - self.board so that the AI may use it
